/// Behavioral proof that dropping an `MLXBackend` releases its `MLXResourceArbiter`
/// claim (#1623 class C — "asymmetric sibling").
///
/// This is the Metal companion to `LlamaBackendResourceReleaseConformanceTest`
/// (fast-lane, refcount-only) and the runtime counterpart to
/// `BackendDeinitSymmetryAuditTest`'s source scan. The audit proves the release
/// token is present in `MLXBackend.deinit`; the two behavioral tests prove the
/// release actually fires. The MLX deinit leak the footgun audit flagged would
/// have been caught here: a backend that claims an arbiter slot on `loadModel` but
/// never releases it leaves `MLX.Memory.clearCache()`'s last-release guarantee
/// permanently un-fired, and this test would see the active-claim count never drop.
///
/// Unlike the Llama claim — synchronous in `init` — the MLX claim is only
/// established **after a real model load** (`MLXResourceArbiter.shared.claim(...)`
/// runs once the container loads on Metal). So this proof cannot live in the
/// fast-lane: it requires Apple Silicon + a Metal device + a discoverable on-disk
/// MLX model, and is skipped otherwise. Release is also **asynchronous** —
/// `deinit` schedules `MLXResourceArbiter.shared.release(backendID:)` in a
/// `Task.detached` that first awaits the prior cleanup task — so the test polls the
/// active-claim count against a deadline rather than asserting immediately.
