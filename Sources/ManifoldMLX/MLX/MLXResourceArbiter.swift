/// Coordinates MLX's process-global GPU buffer cache across multiple
/// `MLXBackend` instances in the same host.
///
/// `MLX.Memory.cacheLimit` and `MLX.Memory.clearCache()` operate on a single
/// process-wide pool. A naive multi-MLX setup — for example, a chat backend
/// plus an embeddings backend, or two `MLXBackend`s loaded for A/B comparison
/// — has the second `loadModel` overwrite the first's `cacheLimit`, and any
/// `clearCache()` from one backend evicts pooled buffers that other backends
/// depend on for KV-cache reuse. Both behaviours corrupt KV reuse silently.
///
/// The arbiter solves this by accumulating per-backend cache claims and
/// programming `MLX.Memory.cacheLimit` to the **sum** of all active claims.
/// `clearCache()` is only invoked on the **last** release — until every MLX
/// backend has unloaded, the cache stays populated so other live backends
/// keep their residue.
///
/// ## Metallib guard
///
/// Every call into `MLX.Memory` is conditioned on the caller having completed
/// at least one successful `loadModelContainer` (the proxy is the caller — it
/// only invokes `claim`/`release` after that gate). The arbiter itself trusts
/// that contract and does not attempt to detect uninitialised runtime state.
/// Calling `MLX.Memory.cacheLimit` before any model has loaded would trip a
/// "Failed to load default metallib" abort in plain `swift test` environments.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// ```swift
/// // After loadModelContainer succeeds:
/// await MLXResourceArbiter.shared.claim(
///     backendID: backendID,
///     requestedCacheBytes: cachePolicy.resolvedBytes()
/// )
///
/// // In unloadModel / cleanup:
/// await MLXResourceArbiter.shared.release(backendID: backendID)
/// ```
///
/// All `MLXBackend` instances must coordinate through `shared`; mixing
/// arbitrated and direct `MLX.Memory.*` calls in the same process defeats the
/// accounting.
